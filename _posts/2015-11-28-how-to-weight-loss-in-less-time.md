## <span style="color: #ff0000;">how to weight loss in Less Time than You Ever Thought Possible</span>

Why [workout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_exercise "Physical exercise") for an hour when fifteen minutes will do? It’s not just about spending less time working out for the sake of spending less time, it’s about getting a better result because you pushed your body harder. You can work out hard or you can work out for a long time, but you can’t do both to achive this question ” **how to weight loss**“.

Stop right there . . . _I know what you’re [thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought "Thought"): I’ll just put the time in and work out for a long time because I don’t want to work out hard, right?_

**Unfortunately, it doesn’t really work that way.**

First of all, you will initially get positive results from your long workouts. That’s because any new exercise program you put your body through will yield some type of result. But burning yourself out and regaining that lost [fat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat "Fat") is right around the corner, so don’t fall prey to this common disaster we call “_**[overtraining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtraining "Overtraining").**_”

Secondly, your body will get used to the volume of work you are doing and resist progress. When it comes to working out, it is probably the thing that I hate the most. Imagine putting in more and more time each week, month, and year and getting nowhere. It happens all the time and I’m sure that you have gone through it yourself at some point. There are two things that we should all be concerned about when it comes to our [health and fitness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness "Physical fitness"): building or maintaining muscle and burning fat. Reshaping your body is best done with high intensity exercise and weights. Reducing [body fat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue "Adipose tissue") is best done with diet—not with hours of cardio.

Are you a skeptic? Keep this thought in mind. Imagine you were a runner for your fitness program and ran five miles a day, seven days a week. You would burn an incredible amount of calories, but provide no muscle stimulation for any other [muscles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle "Muscle") than your legs. Now, add the image of eating an entire pizza for dinner each night as part of your diet. Don’t you think that at the end of a month on this program, even after running a total of 150 miles, that you will get fat? Of course you will! So if you have to watch what you eat anyway, why not do the type of exercise that will stimulate your weight loss, control your appetite better, and shape your arms and glutes the way you want?
